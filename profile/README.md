## 🎯 TLDR: everything you should know about Jukto

> Empowering AI teams to unlock peak GPU performance at scale.

In today’s AI world, every model runs on GPUs, but optimization is scattered. Teams waste weeks manually tuning kernels, configs, and inference engines, leading to inefficient compute and skyrocketing costs.

**Jukto** (Bengali for `connected`) is on a mission to change that. We're building an **AI-Native GPU Kernel Optimization Platform** that unifies fragmented, manual workflows into a single, autonomous layer.

Think of it as "**Jukto: GPU Performance Optimization as a Service**". Tools like Triton and TensorRT have shown what's possible, but they're manual, vendor-locked, and inaccessible for most. Jukto democratizes that power: an accessible, flexible platform built for speed, portability, and collaboration between humans and AI agents.

**Vision: Why Jukto Exists**

Modern AI organizations spend millions on GPU compute, but 90% of it runs at sub-optimal efficiency. Teams waste time wrestling with CUDA, Triton, and hyperparameter tuning, often requiring deep expertise in low-level programming.

> The result? Brilliant engineers trapped in optimization hell — tweaking instead of innovating.

**Jukto changes that.**

While with Jukto, teams can:

- **Generate** CUDA/Triton kernels from PyTorch or natural language descriptions.
- **Optimize** inference configs for vLLM, SGLang, and more using AI-driven exploration.
- **Trace & Analyze** GPU and kernel (memory access, thread divergence, register spills).
- **Deploy** universally across NVIDIA, AMD, AWS, GCP—without rewrites.

  > We connect AI models, hardware, and teams in one real-time, optimized environment.

**The Opportunity**

We’re building **Jukto** to become the platform of choice for AI infrastructure teams where kernel generation, optimization, and deployment come together in one place. We are constantly improving Jukto to **make workflows faster, deliver peak performance, and create a better experience** for users to self-serve, with the goal of making **Jukto** the standard platform for AI-driven GPU operations, so every organization can turn compute into a strategic advantage.

# **System of Action Manifesto**
## *Jukto - AI-Powered GPU Kernel Optimization Platform*  
### *Turn raw compute into peak performance*

---

We didn't build Jukto because we love kernels.  
We built it because we were tired of watching brilliant AI teams waste 20+ hours a week buried under slow inference, inefficient kernels, and endless tuning loops.  

Ask any ML Engineer, Researcher, or Infrastructure Lead:

*"I’m drowning in configs and benchmarks. I know the hardware is capable, but no one has time to unlock its full potential."*

So we started over.  

---

Jukto is not a compiler.
Not a tuner.  
Not another optimizer.  

**Jukto is the first true AI-Native GPU Optimization Platform**  
A place where **humans and AI agents reason together**, live, and evolve kernels in real-time.  

---

Your models? **Already at peak throughput**.  
Your kernels? **Already hardware-optimized**.  
Your inference? **Already 2-3x faster**.  

**Jukto** handles the heavy lifting, so your team can focus on **innovation, not bottlenecks**.  

This is not about minor speedups.  
It’s about turning GPUs into rockets, so your team spends less time debugging compute and more **time training, deploying, and scaling**.
Because no one became an ML engineer or researcher to babysit inefficient kernels.  

---

We’ve talked to teams stuck in vendor lock-in, slowed down by manual tuning, or buried in CUDA code.
The giants had decades to fix this. They didn't.
They promised performance but delivered complexity, then called it **progress**. 

We are not a plugin.  
We are not a faster benchmark.  
We exist so your team stops **wasting 20+ hours a week** on endless configs, broken kernels, and switching between ten different tools.

---

Traditional tools ask:

*"Did you tune your kernels today?"*  

Jukto asks:

**"What model will you scale today? We’ll optimize the rest."**  

This is not software.  
This is liberation.  
This is **the operating system your GPUs deserve**.  

---

We are builders who have lived the chaos.  
We’ve broken kernels, lost nights to benchmarks, and questioned every optimizer we used.  
Now we are building **the AI agent we always wished existed**.  

If you’ve ever said:

*"I could scale faster if my GPUs got out of my way"*  

—this is for you.  

Join us. Be part of building the future of GPU intelligence.

You’ll hear directly from us.  
No sales pitch.  
Just builders who care.  
And you will help shape **what comes next**.
