## üéØ¬†TLDR: everything you should know about Jukto

> Empowering teams to turn data into actionable decisions at scale.

In today‚Äôs world, every business runs on `data`, but insights are scattered. Teams waste hours jumping between SQL, Python, BI dashboards, and reports.

**Jukto** (Bengali for *`connected`*) is on a mission to change that. We're building an **AI-native Self-Serve Collaborative Data Platform** that is designed to unify fragmented workflows into a single, AI-native layer to **connect, analyze, visualize, automate, and collaborate**. 

Think of it as "**Palantir For Data Teams**". **Palantir proved what‚Äôs possible** when data and decisions come together. But Foundry is closed and out of reach for most. Jukto democratizes that power: an accessible, flexible data platform built for transparency, trust, and collaboration between humans and AI.

**Vision: Why Jukto Exists**

Modern organizations spend millions on scattered analytics tools. Teams waste hours managing data instead of making decisions. Traditional dashboards and notebooks are static, siloed, hard to use, and often require specialized knowledge. 

> The result? Brilliant teams trapped in maintenance mode ‚Äî fixing instead of creating.

**Jukto changes that.**

While with Jukto, teams can:

- **Connect** live data from Databricks, Trino, BigQuery, Snowflake, CSV/XLSX, and many more.
- **Analyze** using SQL, Python, or plain English queries with AI agents
- **Visualize** insights through drag-and-drop dashboards
- **Automate** alerts, reports, and agentic workflows
- **Collaboration** with teams in real time, share, and publish effortlessly

  > We bring data, people, and AI together in one real-time, connected environment.

**The Opportunity**

We‚Äôre building **Jukto** to become the *platform of choice* for modern data-driven teams where analytics, automation, and collaboration come together in one place. We are constantly improving Jukto to **make workflows more useful, deliver insights faster, and create a better experience** for users to self-serve, with the goal of making **Jukto** the standard platform for AI-driven data operations, so every organization can turn data into a strategic advantage.

# **System of Action Manifesto**
## *Jukto - AI-native Self-Serve Collaborative Data Platform*  
### *Turn raw data into collective intelligence*

---

We didn't build Jukto because we love dashboards.  
We built it because we were tired of watching brilliant teams waste 20+ hours a week buried under broken pipelines, disconnected tools, and endless dashboards.  

Ask any Analyst, Engineer, or Decision-maker:

*"I‚Äôm drowning in dashboards and emails. I know the data is there somewhere, but no one has time to turn it into insights."*

So we started over.  

---

Jukto is not a BI tool.  
Not a notebook.  
Not another dashboard.  

**Jukto is the first true Collaborative Data Platform**  
A place where **humans and AI reason together**, live, and act in real-time.  

---

Your queries? **Already contextualized**.  
Your reports? **Already interactive**.  
Your insights? **Already actionable**.  

**Jukto** handles the heavy lifting, so your team can focus on **decisions, not chores**.  

This is not about pretty charts/dashboards.  
It‚Äôs about turning data into action, so your team spends less time managing numbers and more time **building, growing, and leading**.
Because no one became a data scientist, analyst, or engineer to babysit broken tools.  

---

We‚Äôve talked to teams stuck in silos, slowed down by approvals, or buried in spreadsheets.
The giants had decades to fix this. They didn't.  
They promised clarity but delivered busywork, then called it **progress**. 

We are not a plugin.  
We are not a prettier report.  
We exist so your team stops **wasting 20+ hours a week** on endless spreadsheets, broken pipelines, and clicking between ten different tools.

---

Traditional tools ask:

*"Did you finish your data chores today?"*  

Jukto asks:

**"What decision will you make today? We‚Äôll handle the rest."**  

This is not software.  
This is liberation.  
This is **the operating system your team deserves**.  

---

We are builders who have lived the chaos.  
We‚Äôve broken pipelines, lost nights to dashboards, and questioned every tool we used.  
Now we are building **the OS we always wished existed**.  

If you‚Äôve ever said:

*"I could move faster if my tools got out of my way"*  

‚Äîthis is for you.  

Join us. Be part of building the future of collaborative intelligence.

You‚Äôll hear directly from us.  
No sales pitch.  
Just builders who care.  
And you will help shape **what comes next**.
